# Queralyze – Natural Language Data Querying & Analytics Platform

## Overview
Queralyze is a natural language–driven data analytics platform that allows non-technical stakeholders to interact with databases using plain English. Instead of writing complex SQL queries or relying on rigid BI dashboards, users can ask questions conversationally and instantly receive insights through interactive visualizations.
The platform bridges the gap between raw data and decision-making by combining Text-to-SQL, real-time dashboards, query history, and rich visual analytics, making data exploration faster, more flexible, and more intuitive.

## Problem Statement
Most decision-makers need quick access to reliable insights, but traditional database systems require SQL expertise, creating a barrier for non-technical users. Existing BI tools often confine users to static, predefined dashboards, limiting real-time analysis and ad-hoc exploration.
Additionally, raw datasets frequently contain inconsistencies, errors, or sensitive information, which reduces trust in analytics and increases the risk of missing critical trends. There is a clear need for a solution that makes databases conversational, supports real-time exploration, and highlights insights using diverse visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.

## Objectives
- Develop a natural language interface that translates user queries into SQL seamlessly.
- Enable real-time, interactive dashboards for accessible data analysis.
- Support integration with multiple database systems for scalability and flexibility.
- Ensure data consistency, accuracy, and protection of sensitive information.
- Provide rich visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps.
- Allow iterative querying through query history and follow-up questions.

## Proposed Solution
Queralyze is designed as an AI-powered analytics platform that transforms plain English questions into SQL queries and executes them on structured data sources. The system presents results through dynamic dashboards and interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore data naturally without technical expertise.

### Key Features

#### Natural Language Querying
- Converts plain English queries into optimized SQL.
- Supports contextual and follow-up questions for smooth interaction.

#### Interactive Dashboards
- Real-time visualization of query results.
- Instant updates with multiple chart formats for better insight discovery.

#### Query History & Iterative Querying
- Maintains a history of user queries.
- Enables refining, revisiting, and branching from previous questions.

#### Data Reliability & Security
- Handles data cleaning and consistency checks.
- Protects sensitive information during analysis.

## Literature Review
### Natural Language to SQL (Text-to-SQL)
Research such as Seq2SQL, SQLNet, and the Spider benchmark has significantly advanced Text-to-SQL systems. While effective in controlled environments, these models struggle with complex schemas and domain adaptability in real-world enterprise databases.

### Query History and Iterative Querying
Traditional BI tools emphasize dashboards but lack support for tracking analytical workflows. Studies show that maintaining query history and enabling iterative refinement improves analytical efficiency and helps users build insights incrementally.

### Advanced Data Visualization Techniques
Modern approaches like multi-view dashboards, interactive filtering, and progressive visual analytics enhance exploratory analysis. However, many systems still treat visualizations as static outputs rather than dynamic tools tightly integrated with querying.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
### Streamlit
- Frontend framework for building the interactive web interface.
- Handles file uploads, user input (natural language & SQL), data display, and dynamic rendering.

### Pandas
- Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Used for reading CSV/Excel files, cleaning data, and preparing datasets for querying.

### SQLite3
- Lightweight in-memory database engine.
- Stores uploaded datasets temporarily and executes SQL queries generated by the AI or user.

### Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- Natural Language Processing and SQL generation.
- Converts user questions into optimized, SQLite-compatible SQL queries.

## Results
- Natural language query execution without SQL knowledge.
- Enhanced accessibility and usability for non-technical users.
- Iterative querying through query history and refinement.
- Save and reuse query results.
- Rich visual representation of data using multiple chart types.
- Chat-style history for tracking analytical workflows.
- Clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface.
- Strong foundation for future scalability and system integration.

## Future Work
- Integration with enterprise-scale databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for secure multi-user environments.
- Advanced anomaly detection and trend forecasting using ML models.
- Support for more complex analytical queries and joins.
- Exportable dashboards and report generation.
- Voice-based querying for hands-free analytics interaction.
